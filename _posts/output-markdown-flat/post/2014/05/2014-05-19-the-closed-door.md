Glad to have shut the door finally

that led nowhere

 Bang I did on it for infinity

 Faint echoes of delusions

still waft across from yonder

but make no sense anymore

The realization struck late but strong

Turn my back I have with firm conviction

to let bygones be

Past stuffed behind there

the door that stands locked

 The key thrown far beyond reach

Facing a new threshold

a fresh start of life anew

Every possibility that feels right

 emerges from nowhere

For the chance I took

 to shut the wrong ones out

 trust my gut

As I tuned the right ones in.
