I started blogging somewhere around six years back. But all these years, this blog was more of a diary that I updated intermittently. It was a journal, a scrapbook of sorts, where I used to jot down my thoughts and a random sprinkling of poetry which I would at times share with friends and family. This April 2014, I came across two major blogging challenges online. On the spur of the moment, I decided to join these challenges although I was late by two weeks. It wasn't easy to write so much in half a month but I sailed through it with great effort. It did give me a huge exposure though. It was through these challenges that I connected with a lot of interesting writers in the blogosphere who wrote on varied genres, some of them being professional novelists and writers. Their thoughts intrigued me, tickled me, and further stimulated me to get inspired by them. It was a turning point for me. I am completely hooked to the habit of regular writing now. Two months through and I haven't looked back ever since.

An award nomination from a fellow blogger whose writing resonates with my thoughts is a lot more than an award. It reflects her interest in my writing and also my respect for hers. It confirms my affirmation that I am on the right track._The word 'Liebster' is of German origins and it has several definitions: dearest, sweetest, kindest, nicest, beloved, lovely, kind, pleasant, valued, cute, endearing, welcome, sweetheart, and boyfriend, being among them. Some describe this award as a daisy chain. You get nominated for the award and if you choose to accept, you get to nominate additional bloggers for the award. You answer their questions, the new bloggers nominated answer yours, and so the chain of happiness continues to grow and expand._

I am elated to announce that I have been nominated by [Stephanie Bird](http://stephanierosebirdstudio.blogspot.in/) for the Liebster award! This gesture of hers comes as a pleasant surprise to me. We have been following each other's blogs regularly for quite some time now and in the process, I have discovered a lot of common interests with her. It is her paintings, yoga, healing, and a host of other topics I connect with, besides of course her writings which take me to her blog every time she posts something new. Thank you so much, Stephanie! The fact that you liked my blog enough to nominate it for this award is quite encouraging.

So, what is this all about? You may be wondering what the Liebster Award is right about now. Here is a description:

**These are the 11 questions that Stephanie had asked me:**

1\.    What is your favorite day of the year and why? _My favorite day of the year is the first day of the year, January 1st since it brings with it a sense of a new beginning and resolutions. It's like a fresh new start every year._

2\.    Which fairytale resonates with you the most? _My personal favorite fairytale is Cinderella. It makes you believe in a better tomorrow if you're on the right track. No matter how tough your current situation is._

3\.    What is the most important thing for you to do daily? _The most important thing I do daily is consciously trying to feel grateful for all that I have been blessed with. It keeps me away from negativity and opens my eyes to all things positive._

4\.    What do you wish you had more time to do? _I wished I had more time to read and write. There's always a paucity of time to do the same in the desired measures._

5\.    If money was no object what would you spend your time doing? _If money was not an issue I would have spent my time traveling and exploring the world._

6\.    If you could have one magical ability what would it be? _If I could have one magic ability, I would want to know what the other person is thinking through my magical powers. That would help in so many situations!_

7\.    With which animal do you feel the most affinity? _I adore dogs for their loyalty and unconditional love._

8\.    Where do you go for inspiration for your blog? _I get inspired to blog by about anything. A mundane incident, interesting experiences, a quote, a picture, or just random thoughts and opinions._

9\.    If you could have a one-on-one interview with any author, poet or artist, living or deceased, who would you interview? _If I would have got a chance, I would have interviewed the late renowned dancer Protima Bedi. Her autobiography is truly inspirational._

10\. What would you most like to try that you have never done before? _I would like to travel all by myself to an unexplored destination. I've had it on my mind for long but am yet to do it._

11\. Pick one word that sums up your work? _Experiences._

**Okay...so its now time to reveal those 11 random facts about me! Stop yawning, will you?!**

3. _I need my morning cup of coffee just as much as I need air to survive._
4. _My smartphone is my best friend these days._

8. _I need my daily dose of music to keep me going well._

10. _There's a die-hard foodie in me who loves exploring new cuisines._ 
11. _I'm a gypsy at heart and it's hard to pin me down in one place._

**And here are some awesome blogs that I am nominating for the Liebster Award:**

These are blogs I regularly follow for the simple reason that I connect with the thoughts of the writers. Some of them probe me to think deeper. Some amuse me with their element of humor. And some leave me speechless with the sheer power of words. My own inspiration to write gets a boost every time I read an amazing post by one of these writers. I have connected with some of them only recently, but nevertheless I do enjoy reading the posts that they write. There are some more people I would have liked to add to this list, who again have a beautiful way with words, but I am not nominating them only because of the knowledge that they are refusing award nominations for their own reasons, which I fully respect. If you have enjoyed reading my posts, I am sure you would love reading the blogs mentioned below. Do visit them. Leave them a comment if you connect with their posts. They do deserve a much larger audience!
