_Fading photographs make rich memories._

_Framed forever in timeless stupor..._

_Freezing moments in captivity,_

_For the heart knows that the moment once gone,_

_Is lost for ever..._

_Moments that act like raindrops._

_Some get absorbed in the soil that soon yields green._

_And some get lost in the ocean that storms a tsunami._

_Yet every moment for reasons unknown,_

_Makes us_

_Breaks us_

_Takes us_

_through the journey of life._

_A journey that we capture through our lens._

_Lest the forgetful heart deceives the memory._

_In an instant of sepia tinted reminiscences,_

_as I flick through the reservoir of memories._

_Yet again,_

_unfolds the journey that made me._ _[Ultimate Blog Challenge](http://ultimateblogchallenge.com/)_
