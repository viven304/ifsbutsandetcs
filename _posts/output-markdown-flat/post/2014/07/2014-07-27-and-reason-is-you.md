He dialed the radio station’s number with a little uncertainty. It was that time of the day when his favorite program on the popular FM radio channel was aired. He adored the particular radio jockey who hosted that time slot. Her vivacious and chirpy voice brightened his mornings when he drove to work.

_"Hey there...how can Super-girl Alisha help you today buddy?"_ her bubbly voice cracked up the confines of his car.

_“Hi, Alisha, I'm a great fan of yours!"_

_“Awesome! So, what's your name, where are you from and what do you do?"_ she shot him the usual questions in her mechanically mastered cheery manner.

_“Hey Ashish here, from Goregaon. I work as a marketing executive for an MNC. I wish to dedicate a song to my dearest wife Sarika on our tenth wedding anniversary today."_

_"Oh...how romantic! Which track do you have in mind, Ashish?"_

_"The Reason, by Hoobastank. That's our song,"_ he replied with a shy smile.

The broad smile on Alisha's face suddenly got wiped out, replaced by a deep furrow on her forehead as her face went pale.

Their song, is it? Wife? She wondered with a sudden surge of obscure emotions in her.

_"Right on. Ashish, can you help me with your full name please?"_ she went on inquisitively in her thick accent, her ears now sharp and alert to the familiar voice that came from the other side.

_"I’m Ashish Goyal. On this special day, I want to tell my wife, Sarika Goyal, how much she means to me. I wouldn't swap her for any other woman for all my coming life-times."_

The line suddenly went dead much to Ashish's disappointment and surprise.

She gazed blankly at the microphone. So...she wasn't the only one who had lied to him. She had lied to him about her vocation with the hope that Ashish Goyal, her boyfriend of two years, would easily agree for marriage if she told him that she was school teacher instead of her actual vocation as a radio jockey. She had feared that her unconventional profession of a radio jockey would not be easily accepted by him as per his expectations of a homely wife.

It was a day of some bitter and shocking revelations for Super-girl Alisha aka Aparna Singh.

In no time he heard the radio playing his request. Doug Robb from Hoobastank sang away to the irony of the situation:

_I'm not a perfect person_

_There's many things I wish I didn't do_

_But I continue learning_

_I never meant to do those things to you_

_And so I have to say before I go_

_That I just want you to know_

_I've found a reason for me_

_To change who I used to be_

_A reason to start over new_

_And the reason is you_

_I'm sorry that I hurt you_

_It's something I must live with every day_

_And all the pain I put you through_

_I wish that I could take it all away_

_And be the one who catches all your tears_

_That's why I need you to hear_

_I've found a reason for me_

_To change who I used to be_

_A reason to start over new_

_And the reason is you_

_And the reason is you_

_And the reason is you_

_And the reason is you_

_I'm not a perfect person_

_I never meant to do those things to you_

_And so I have to say before I go_

_That I just want you to know_

_I've found a reason for me_

_To change who I used to be_

_A reason to start over new_

_And the reason is you_

_I've found a reason to show_

_A side of me you didn't know_

_A reason for all that I do_

_**And the REASON is YOU.**_
