Dear Son

You've known your mother as a fairly disciplined person when it comes to wellness and health. While I am a partner in your crime the day you wish to sin by digging into a box of creamy doughnuts and I also help you finish the last crumb that you order from Burger King, there are days that you've seen me drawing the line.

All these years saw me monitoring your diet and other activities to keep your lifestyle balanced and healthy. A few months from now, you will be solely in charge of your wellbeing. When you start living by yourself you tend to slip on a 'devil may care' attitude when it comes to eating healthy food and taking proper rest. High on the rush of the adventures of a new place you might push it at the back of your priority list. The foodie that you are, I am sure that you will never go hungry but my concern is about your love for all the rich food that you love to indulge yourself with. We share a common love for exploring different kinds of food, but knowing how overindulgence acts on the body in a long run has kept me balanced in terms of knowing when to stop. While I do not claim to be the healthiest person around with the fittest body, a few ground rules have helped me keep myself in a good condition so far. These are my secrets for looking younger than my age, as most people like to put it! ;)

**Sleep** 

No matter what kind of sleep schedule your friends and roomies have, try to stick to your own schedule on regular days. A random day of going out or staying up is okay once in a few days or maybe on weekends. But on regular days try sleeping at the same time everyday, latest before 11pm. A quick shower before you hit the bed will ensure that the day's weariness is washed away and you sleep well. Your advantage of being an early riser is always going to give you an edge above others. Use the tranquility of early mornings to take a stroll or simply relax outdoors. If not outdoors, a balcony or window sill is a good place to chill with your morning cup of coffee. I usually prefer gazing at the greenery, the skies or birds. Just for your knowledge, gazing at green color is supposed to be healthy for your eyes. Those first few thoughts that we reflect on after waking up in the morning are crucial in building a positive mind frame for the day ahead.

**Diet**

A heavy wholesome breakfast is a must. Do not compromise on this meal. Try finding warm and fresh alternatives on the menu for breakfast. Skip the cereal and pasta, no matter how tempting it sounds. Instead go for healthier options like eggs and whole wheat bread. Try and have whole fresh fruits and salads instead of having juices or aerated drinks. I know it is a little difficult to keep an eye on the menu when you're in a hurry, but it will go a long way in keeping you healthy. Do not miss meals. Ensure that you have regular meals at a stipulated time. Avoid the temptation of filling up with fast food during your meals on frequent basis. Go easy on caffeine. Keep your intake to maximum two cups a day. You could opt for green tea instead. Keep a tab on having too much of sugary and fried food. Try and eat something every two hours. It need not be a huge meal. Just a handful of nuts should do. Resist the urge to binge on stuff like chips and chocolates. Treat yourself on some days with the food that you crave for. An occasional ice-cream, maybe. These tips will not only keep your metabolism in check, but also keep those pesky pimples at bay.

**Exercise**

Do not ignore the benefits of exercise. If you cannot devote a dedicated time especially for exercise, try to squeeze it into your routine by either walking down to places, climbing stairs instead of taking the elevator, or simply pacing up and down when you attend to a phone call. A bit of sweating releases the feel-good endorphins that the body so badly requires. I'm not a big fan of gyming but if you feel you can live up to the commitment of going to the gym in your campus everyday, do so. However, listen to your body when it shows signs of exhaustion. Do not compare your stamina with others. Every person is made up of a different constitution. What works for them might not work for you. The day you feel drained, simply take a day off, relax and charge yourself.

**Grooming**

Every once in a while indulge yourself with the luxury of a professional pedicure or massage. These privileges are no longer limited to women. Men need to de-stress too. Stick to the routine hygiene standards that you have been raised with so far. When you start living with new people it is natural to get influenced by their habits. A sloppy appearance makes you seem less approachable. Over and above this, a neat appearance and smart dressing will never lose its class. Daily baths in the morning is what works for us Indians, and it always will. Offering a quiet prayer after the bath gives peace of mind. Especially since you've been doing it since your childhood, continue doing so.

Always remember, moderation is the key to having a balanced life. Know your limits in everything you do and work around it accordingly. We live only once, so it doesn't make sense to deprive ourselves of things that we wish to do. However, not going overboard works well in the long run.

No matter how much of material wealth we make in life, if we are unable to maintain our health and wellness, we will never be able to enjoy the fruits of our labor. Do everything that your heart craves for but be mindful of how much and how often you do it. Have a wholesome and healthy life, my child. God bless you.

Love Ma
