From the crowd they emerge

Single themselves to walk into your life.

Filling it with myriad emotions

A sprinkling of laughter and tears here...

a dash of anger and disappointment there...

Spawning a series of memoirs

For future reminiscing.

And, after a zillion megabytes of times spent together

There comes an invisible moment,when least expected

Back they go to the very crowd they came from

Mingling in oblivion.

Leaving you just a footprint

of memories...

Some to be cherished

And some to fade.

Wonder how it works...

It is the crowd that brings them to you...

...and the same crowd that sucks them back from you.

Nevertheless it happens

And no mortal can stop

The inevitability of this vicious cycle Of hope and despair

But still

We live in hope

That yet another day

To enrich your life

One more would get singled out.

While the crowd drums its fingers impatiently in the background

Watching yet another inception of memories...

Those of which the indecipherable life boasts of

Much after it is no more.
