Sometime I wonder

why we met Miles apart Yet closer than skin Psyches so different Yet so in sync We walk in And walk out As we please But the rhythm of the rendezvous Unmistakably familiar.

Are you the angel God designated for me? And if so, where are your wings? Weren't they put on you to shorten distances, Bridge gaps, Waste no time, And when I need Fly to me ?

Misplaced are they by any chance? Look into your closet Maybe the loft Check with your laundry Do something Find them quick

Cos I need you to wear them now Spread wide on your shoulders to soar Flutter across to me in no while and cast the light of your halo So brilliant On the dark demons that hover above me Blind them with the glare of your radiant aura Shoo them forever And enable the rays to permeate through to soak my soul with eternal bliss.
