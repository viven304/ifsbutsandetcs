Time to translate the imagination to reality. Got my roomie to be my muse for a day. Her halter n harem pants look for a casual evening out, were just incomplete without my happy colored pair ofÂ  'khadaus'. So well, here goes...we ended up painting her nails a cheery unconventional butter yellow to make them worthy for the color riot.
