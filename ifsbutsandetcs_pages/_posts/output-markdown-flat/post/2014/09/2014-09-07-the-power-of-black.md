 Her dreaded weapon had dropped dead many

Deep, deft powerful strokes, that yielded the sharpness of a knife's edge

Not once did she flinch as she went around creating drama, every single time she cast a spell of enigma

The mesmerizing liquid pools shone arrogantly as the veil of her eyelashes revealed the kohl streaked dangerously along the rims of her eyes

Black, alluring and sinister.
