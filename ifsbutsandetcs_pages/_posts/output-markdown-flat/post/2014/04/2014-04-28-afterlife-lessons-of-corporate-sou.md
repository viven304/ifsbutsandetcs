Sometime, someday, when I'm up there

Lounging without a care on a fluffy cloud

Blowing away lazy rings of mist

as I float in the bliss of heaven...

I shall gaze down fondly at my people

to see a few weeping for me

Some close ones pining for me

reminiscing memories of me.

 A handful more who sense my loss

Who would I expect to see?

 Let me guess...

...pulling out my divine binoculars to look for those

whom I spent the maximal earth time with

The multinational company

I rendered my sweat to, for precious long earth years

The boss who's word was greater than the lord's

The colleagues who I thought were friends

 subordinates who respected me till my expiry period.

Were they the ones?

And, what would I see...?

....conveniently forgotten

I was just a name in their file.

I see someone new

Hired in my place

Doing my job, maybe better than me

He seemed to have won them over

For, he too was doling out his sweat

In lieu of his passions

Spending festivals at his office desk

to keep the boss's word

Sharing work gossips over drinks

with those colleagues

who backbit to get ahead of you.

 Did I make the most

of those shortly timed earth years

Shouldn't I have spent

fun filled festivals

with my old parents who shaped my life

happy birthdays

with siblings who colored my childhood with vibrant memories

languorous holidays

with the one who taught me to love differently

leisurely evenings

with friends who shared with me, my ups and downs

and every single day

with my child who gave me a new lease of life?

The accolades were long forgotten

 Like those degrees and certificates that now collect dust.

Realize I will a tad too late, that all I carried up there was

 the little wealth of  joy, sorrow, warmth and compassion

which I had shared only with my people.

And not with my emotionless office desk.
