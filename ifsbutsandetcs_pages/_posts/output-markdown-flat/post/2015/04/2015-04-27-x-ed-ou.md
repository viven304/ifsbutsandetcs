**\*\*\***

Today's words are

**'X out or X-ed out****'**

which means to delete what's written from a list,

record by ticking it, crossing it over,

drawing a line through it.

He quickly scanned the tiny café once more. He shook his head as his nose flared red in annoyance. His parents had confirmed that she would be there to meet him by 5 pm sharp. It was well past 6 pm and there was still no sign of her. &nbsp;Her cell phone was switched off and her parents had no clue on where she was held up.</div><div style="font-size: medium; text-align: left;"></div><div style="font-size: medium; text-align: left;">Indian matchmaking - no matter how progressive it got, had its own loop holes.

Murli repulsively spat out the coffee that he had sipped meanwhile and glared at the waiter. <i>“You rascal…the coffee is ice-cold and you have the nerve to ask me if I want to order more crap to go with this pathetic coffee?!”</i> he muttered in a pitch that made the people seated around them to turn their attention to the ruckus, as the waiter apologized profusely clearing up the mess.</div><div style="font-size: medium; text-align: left;"></div><div style="font-size: medium; text-align: left;">Meenakshi sucked in a deep breath and <b>X-ed out </b>the last row of Xs that were untouched, on the maze of Tic Tac Toe game in the newspaper lying on her table. She quietly stood up from the corner table of the café from where she had been observing the drama. She smiled at the kind waiter and left him a decent tip. &nbsp;Adjusting her stiff cotton sari with determination, she switched on her cell phone and spoke firmly into it as she walked out of the café. <i>“No Appa, he won’t do. He's disrespectful,” </i>She paused to listen to her dad's reaction. <i>“No, he did not say a thing to me but I can’t spend my life with someone who cannot treat everyone alike.”</i></div>Linking this to the&nbsp;<a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/">Blogging from A to Z (April 2015)</a>&nbsp;for the letter X.<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://ifsbutsandsetcs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/X.jpg"><img src="images/X.jpg" border="0"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
