My theme for this year's

Blogging from A to Z Challenge is called the

**[_"THE POWER OF TWO."_](http://ifsbutsandsetcs.com/2015/03/22/the-power-of-two/)**

**Click [here](https://www.blogger.com/) to read more about it.**

**\*\*\***

Today's words are

**'Deal with.'**

which literally means to take action to do something,

 especially to solve a problem.

The world says you can't, but you know you should. What strikes to you as right but to others as wrong are collective fences we've built around ourselves, trapping our minds in the space that society created for us without an afterthought for individual needs. Sometimes one needs to figure out what's best for us individually by stepping out of this restricting mindset that we have been conditioned to think with. **Deal with** these dogmas and break free from the shackles that bind us into restrictions cause' one glove can never fit all and it sure is a big deal - to **deal with** something that fits you poorly. So, go find your glove and slip your soul into it with spirited abandon!
