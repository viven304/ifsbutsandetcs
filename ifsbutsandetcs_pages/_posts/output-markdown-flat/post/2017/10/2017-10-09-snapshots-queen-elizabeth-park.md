<!--more-->Vancouver is known for its scenic public parks. After experiencing the gorgeous highlights of Stanley Park I decided to check out Queen Elizabeth Park. The profusion of colors that greet you as you step into this green paradise has you spell-bound for moments absorbing every ounce of the beauty that waits for you at every step. Exotic blooms of every imaginable hue smile back from carefully manicured carpets of landscaped gardens.

_Queen Elizabeth Park, Vancouver’s horticultural jewel, is a major draw for floral display enthusiasts and view-seekers, and as a popular backdrop for wedding photos. At 152_ metres _above sea level, it’s the highest point in Vancouver and makes for spectacular views of the park, city, and mountains on the North Shore._ _The 52-hectare park is home to the stunning Bloedel Conservatory. There is also a gorgeously landscaped quarry garden, the arboretum with its collection of exotic and native trees, sculptures including one by internationally renowned artist Henry Moore, and diverse recreational offerings such as tennis, lawn_ bowling_, and pitch & putt. The park is also the perfect setting for fine dining at Seasons in the Park, a picnic or stargazing! [Source](http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/queen-elizabeth-park.aspx)_

_Titled, Love in the Rain, by artist Bruce Voyce, the steel sculpture depicts four entwined couples, each beneath an umbrella. Couples are invited to lock padlocks to the new sculpture as a way to symbolize their love. Locks can be attached to the skirts of each couple, and keys can be deposited into a special box on site. All keys will eventually be recycled or melted down to become part of another piece of public art. The piece celebrates the shelter that love brings and the union that it forms. The human forms in each couple have been made to appear ageless and genderless. [Source.](https://www.straight.com/arts/777701/photos-love-locks-sculpture-unveiled-queen-elizabeth-park)_

I found the concept somewhat similar to something we do in India when we tie holy threads on a particular tree at certain auspicious places. These colored threads are symbolic of the wishes we pray for to come true. Tying the wish into a knot strengthens our resolve to make it come true. In this case, the lock replaces the knot to signify permanence. I was touched by the romantic profoundness of it.

As we strolled through the paths shaded by trees, lined with flowerbeds and lush shrubs, we paused once in a while completely sucked into the magic of the view that unfolded in front of us from a certain angle. The urge to click pictures and freeze these prepossessing sights into memories was insatiable.

Looks like a painter had spread his love for colors across his canvas.[![](images/b31-1024x768.jpg)](http://ifsbutsandsetcs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/b31.jpg)

This called for a click and I did not disappoint them! This set of sculptures gets you to smile in amusement instantly. Just the right antidote for a perfect picture.

So enthralled I am by the captivating sights of this park that I ended up writing very little on this post. I feel the pictures are enough to say it all. There are some places that come close to your imagination of heaven. For me, Queen Elizabeth Park is one of them.
